# What happened?

I guess I just lost interest?
After I initially got the site running with Jekyll ~2 years ago I was really happy with it.
But I quickly realized that Jekyll was the wrong templating engine choice.


It was also my first attempt at a statically generated site.
It had a lot of issues and I quickly realized it would need a rewrite.


And as with most things, I've been putting that rewrite off forever.


I also didn't really have much to say, the landing page was filled with Lorem ipsum placeholders and I didn't want to write any blog posts on a site that was totally unfinished.


Long story short, the project died.


I don't know if I have much more to say now compared to when I first got the site running,
but for what it's worth, **the site is back!**


I got rid of the landing page placeholders,
made it much cleaner and more my style.
I rewrote the whole thing with Hugo,
I have automatic site builds when changes happen upstream
and like the old site, the whole thing is [open-source](https://github.com/k8ieone/site).


There are still pretty major issues with how I (or rather someone over at W3C - it's heavily based on their W3CSS templates) made the site. But I'm no web developer. It's good enough for now.


Expect more content very soon.
