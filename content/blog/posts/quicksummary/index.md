# So how is life?

My last post is from ~2 years ago. That's a long time.


I'd like to give a brief (I'll try, I swear) overview of everything important that happened.


## University

I dropped out before finishing the first semester.
I failed two main subjects which left me with too little credit to pass the semester.


I was extremely desperate. I thought I was a complete failure.


## More attempts

I looked for another university.
I kept believing that getting a degree is the most important thing ever.


First I applied for a degree in film-making. I didn't pass the entry exams tho.


After that failure I applied for the same degree that I failed before.


I passed the entry exams, but after a deep look within myself, I realized that might not be the best path for me.


## Looking for a job

Before the semester started I looked around for a possible job.
I think I wrote to ~6 companies and only one responded.


And they responded positively!


The hiring process was nothing out of the ordinary so I won't go into any details here.


So I got my first job!

## Work life

Starting work was nearly the best thing I ever did.
Once I got used to a daily routine of driving to work, working, driving back home, having a few hours of free time, I thought this is it.
This is my perfect life.


## Moving out

I started dating my current girlfriend mid-November 2023. We stayed with my parents for a few months but we quickly realized that's not viable long-term.


We moved out some time in April 2024.


This is where the perfect life ended.

## Living on your own

I didn't expect much to change. I'd go to work, go back home, have some free time, do some chores and go to sleep.


But a lot has changed. Those chores I mentioned happen to take up a lot more of the free time that I was used to having than I expected.


We're both still figuring out how to live on our own. Mainly I am.

## And that's it!

I hope I'll be able to provide more life updates as they happen instead of making these types of summary posts.
